# H4X0R News

## Overview

H4X0R News is a user-friendly app designed for reading Hacker News articles directly within the app interface. Users can access articles via a built-in web view, ensuring seamless browsing. The app fetches the latest data from Hacker News API for up-to-date news content.

## What I've learned

* Learn to work with SwiftUl Lists and the Identifiable Protocol.
* Use a Navigation View to navigate between the List and a Detail View.
* Advanced State management using the Observer Design Pattern.
* Learn to incorporate a UIKit component into SwiftUI by using WebKit to display web pages in your app.
* Learn to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols.
